# EEG-Trust-assessment-model

## Introduceï¼š
This is a driver trust level recognition model based on EEG signals, written in Python version 3.8. Our aim is to contribute to the EEG application of trust assessment, promote the development of this field, and achieve real-time trust assessment across various fields, promoting replicable research and making it as easy for other researchers to use and compare these models on their data as possible.

## Research model:
	Decision Tree (DT)
	K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	Random Forest (RF)
	Adaptive Boosting(AdaBoost)
	Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)
	Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
	Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)
	Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
